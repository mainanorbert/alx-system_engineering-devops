# 0x0B. SSH
- SH stands for Secure Shell, and it is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage network devices and services over a potentially unsecured network. SSH provides a secure channel over an insecure network by using strong encryption to protect the communication between a client and a server.

- The primary purpose of SSH is to allow users to log into and execute commands on remote machines securely. It also provides a secure way to transfer files between computers using the associated protocols like SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

## Key Features of SSH:

`Encryption:` SSH encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server, including the login credentials and any commands or data exchanged during the session. This helps to protect sensitive information from being intercepted by malicious entities.

`Authentication:` SSH uses various authentication methods to verify the identity of users, including passwords, public key authentication, and more advanced methods like multi-factor authentication. Public key authentication is often preferred for its security benefits.

`Port Forwarding:` SSH supports port forwarding, allowing users to securely tunnel their connections through the encrypted SSH session. This can be useful for accessing services on a remote server as if they were local.

`Key-based Authentication:` Instead of relying solely on passwords, SSH allows users to use cryptographic keys for authentication. This method is generally considered more secure than password-based authentication.i
