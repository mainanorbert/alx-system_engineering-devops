# Networking basics #1
This project covers the following concepts:
## Localhost:
localhost is a hostname that refers to the current device used to access it. It is used to establish network connections to the same device used to access it, which is typically the loopback network interface. In other words, it points to the device itself.
Purpose: localhost is commonly used for testing and development. When you access a web server running on your local machine, you can use "http://localhost" in your web browser to access the server.
IP Address: The IP address associated with localhost is usually 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) or ::1 (IPv6).
## 0.0.0.0:
`0.0.0.0` is a special IP address that usually represents "all available network interfaces" or "any address." It can be used as a placeholder to bind a service or server to all network interfaces on a host.
`Purpose:` Binding to 0.0.0.0 makes a service accessible from any network interface on the host. It's often used when you want a service to listen on all available network interfaces, allowing it to accept incoming connections from any IP address.
`Usage:` For example, if a web server binds to 0.0.0.0 on port 80, it listens on all network interfaces, and you can access it using the host's IP address or domain name from any device on the network.
