# Firewall
A firewall is a network security system designed to monitor, control, and manage incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. Firewalls are crucial for protecting computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and malicious activities.
